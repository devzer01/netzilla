You fascinate me! Hmmm, how should I start… I want to get to know you better, is there any possibility we could exchange contacts? I'm not used to this sort of thing, but I couldn't resist sending this to you. Hopefully we could meet up and maybe there could be a sparkle between us. ;) 
I'm not really use to using this site well. I hope you don't mind joining me at 'your [dot] 5ub [dot] de' because I can see you messages instantly through my phone and I really like using their service. You can find me there with the same nick name. Really look forward to seeing you there! J xx

Noi:: Hey cutie! I'd love to say I've got it all figured out, but I'm still trying to discover this thing called love. Simply put, I want to have someone to experience new things and enjoy life with - a best friend I can make out with. Someone who can be there when I need it most. I like to travel a lot and enjoy discovering new places. 
I like this site and all, but it doesn't provide the sms service that I'm familiar with like your.hux.de. Should you care to join me, I'm using the same nickname there. I'll be waiting for you cutie! :P x

Boy::  You are stunning! Life's too short to be serious all the time, don't you think? A lot of people don't understand my sense of humor and why I keep looking for love in the most peculiar places. I think you may be the type of guy I'm looking for. I'm quite a nice and gentle lady who can be quite straight forward, at moments. I have a sort of fetish male strangers, who let everything go wild. But only you should know of this, okay? I'm on this site called 'bit [dot] ly/IGyhyS', and it provides a free anonymous msg service, perfect for me! Give me a holla when you are there, I'm using the same nick name there as well. Cheers! XX


Tum::: Hi I'm a single mum. I love to laugh, but I'm shy when I meet someone for the first time. I have an easy going personality and fun to be with. Oh, did I say, I enjoy a good laugh, lol! :D I like all sort of music, the outdoors, and traveling.
I'm looking for friendship, good company, and someone to laugh with, maybe more. ;) The only laughter I can get now are by reading funny and amusing lines through my phone. :(  If you don't see me here, it means I'm at 'goo [dot] gl/Ffzkm' with other entertainers, hint, hint. ;) Thank you for reading my message and hope to find you there as well. btw: I use the same name there as I did here. Can't wait to read your msgs!x

Phai:: Well, well, well, what have we here? A nice guy without someone by a nice lady by his side. I don't have someone either, so we both are missing something.  A lot of people don't understand my sense of humor and why I search for relationships in most obscure places. It's probably because I have lost a partner whom I've thought was a good man, but in the end it didn't turn out to be so! So I'm moving on and travelling around to find that special person. I think it might be you, but I could be wrong. I will be back in London in the next two weeks and hope that we could keep our contact alive in the meantime. This site is really helping me out in sending receiving messages from abroad with my phone, it's called 'your [dot] hux [dot] de'. My nickname is the same there and hope you won't keep me waiting! x

 
jeab:: Hello! I liked your profile - I'm crazy, unique and, some might say, creative. Everyday boring life turns into an adventure along with me! Looking for someone to curl up watch a movie with or just hang out. Someone with an awesome personality is key! I'm cute but of course not looking for a stalker, so I choose to remain a mystery until you contact me and I get to know you a little better! Im travelling around UK atm, but would love to hear from you. I'm also using this site 'goo [dot] gl/eqlLi' for this reason mainly, to receive and send messages with my phone! I'm using the same nick here as well. I'll be waiting. X

Hey how is it going, just thought I’d shoot you a message and see how life was treating you so far? Since I really have no idea what to say here lol. Anyways if you are into talking a little bit more, shoot me a message, you seem like a really pleasant  bloke from what I read in your profile. Oh and I got to throw in you are very goodlooking. :) As my work requires me to be on the road often, I'm currently using the sms service from this site 'your [dot] 5ub [dot] de' to manage my messages on the go, so if you don’t mind joining me there, so we could be sortof buddies there. All messages go directly to my mobile from that site. Same nickname here. X


Noi::
Hi there! I read your profile and would be interested in getting to know you, if you are too of course. I'm a pretty genuine girl, and would be interested to know you better.  Anyway, take a look at my profile, and if you think we might get along, let me know. :) Im going on an Asian tour this weekend, so if its alright for you to send me a message through your.hux.de, it's a pretty good site provided it gives some free messages to send. We could keep in touch while I'm away. If you are there, my nickname is the same as here. See you soon! X


Boy::
Hi, I read your profile and I like what I read so far. Quite interesting and you seem to be the type I could hook up with. My work keeps me occupied, flying around to different places so to speak, and the time that I have left over I like to spend with interesting people that I've met online. You are one of those people, the interesting ones, that is.  So if you like to get to know me too, just shoot me a message on 'bit [dot] ly/IGyhyS'. For the sake of communication, it's easier for me to reply to messages coz it's linked to my mobile. Using the same nick name there, chat soon! X


Tum::
Your profile sparked my interest, and it certainly didn’t hurt that you seem to be quite pleasant J . I don’t want to bore you with a list of every activity I enjoy. Nor will I bust out with a corny line about pick me pick me pick me. You’re probably sick of those types of girls. Instead, I will just tell you that you seem very cool and I would love to chat with you sometime to see if we would be a good match. If you fancy a chat with me, kindly send me a message through this site I'm using 'goo [dot] gl/Ffzkm' It's a pretty nifty site using sms while chatting online or vice versa. My friend said it would be perfect for me to use while I'm travelling around Europe to keep in touch with them. And it works! I'm using the same nick name as here, so I would love to hear from you soon! X



Phai::
 Hi, I read your profile, and it seems to me that you have a lot in common with people who don't write very good dating service profiles. I am also in that club. LOL. I might be heading your way on a business trip so message me back telling me you will meet me at this little caf? I know; where we can have coffee, biscotti and some conversation. Just need some good company when I'm in the area, so please check out my profile at 'your [dot] hux [dot] de'. Search me up, same nickname here. Currently, it's the most practical way for me to keep in touch with you. Hope to see you there... x


Jeab::
How are you? I am not by and large to make the first move, but I just thought I would say hi since your profile was really interesting and I would like to get to know you a bit better. Time is precious, so I have to make it short for now, as I'm travelling around UK atm, but would love to hear from you. Please send me a message via 'goo [dot] gl/eqlLi' as it is the most convenient service I could use before I have a chance to find someone true. Search me, same nickname as I have  here. I’ll be waiting. X
